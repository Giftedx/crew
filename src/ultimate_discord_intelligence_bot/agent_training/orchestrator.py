# Agent Performance Monitoring Integration

To integrate performance monitoring into your Discord bot, add these hooks:

## 1. In your command handler (after agent response):

```python
from ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot.agent_training.performance_monitor import AgentPerformanceMonitor

monitor = AgentPerformanceMonitor()

# Record the interaction
monitor.record_agent_interaction(
    agent_name=agent_name,
    task_type=task_type,
    tools_used=tools_used,
    tool_sequence=tool_sequence,
    response_quality=quality_score,  # You'll need to calculate this
    response_time=response_time,
    user_feedback=user_feedback_dict,
    error_occurred=error_occurred,
    error_details=error_details
)
```

## 2. Quality Assessment

Implement a simple quality scoring system:

```python
def assess_response_quality(response: str, expected_criteria: dict) -> float:
    quality_score = 0.0

    # Length appropriateness (0.2 weight)
    if 100 <= len(response) <= 2000:
        quality_score += 0.2

    # Contains fact-checking (0.3 weight)
    if any(phrase in response.lower() for phrase in ["verified", "fact-check", "source"]):
        quality_score += 0.3

    # Shows reasoning (0.3 weight)
    if any(phrase in response.lower() for phrase in ["because", "analysis", "evidence"]):
        quality_score += 0.3

    # No error indicators (0.2 weight)
    if not any(phrase in response.lower() for phrase in ["error", "failed", "unable"]):
        quality_score += 0.2

    return quality_score
```

## 3. Weekly Performance Reports

Add this to your monitoring script:

```python
def generate_weekly_reports():
    monitor = AgentPerformanceMonitor()

    for agent_name in ["enhanced_fact_checker", "content_manager", "cross_platform_intelligence_gatherer"]:
        report = monitor.generate_performance_report(agent_name, days=7)
        monitor.save_performance_report(report)

        # Log key metrics
        print(f"{agent_name}: Overall Score {report.overall_score:.2f}")
        print(f"  Recommendations: {len(report.recommendations)}")
        print(f"  Training Suggestions: {len(report.training_suggestions)}")
```

# CrewAI Agent Training & Enhancement Guide

## Overview

This system enhances CrewAI agents with:
- **Synthetic Training Data**: 50+ examples per agent with varying complexity
- **Enhanced Prompting**: Tool usage guidelines and reasoning frameworks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-world usage tracking and optimization
- **Autonomous Learning**: Continuous improvement based on outcomes

## Enhanced Agents

The following agents have been enhanced with advanced capabilities:

### 1. Enhanced Fact Checker
- **Specialty**: Multi-source fact verification with source credibility assessment
- **Key Tools**: fact_check_tool, claim_extractor_tool, context_verification_tool
- **Reasoning Style**: Verification-focused with bias detection
- **Performance Target**: 90% accuracy, 95% source verification rate

### 2. Content Manager
- **Specialty**: Comprehensive content analysis and quality assessment
- **Key Tools**: pipeline_tool, sentiment_tool, topic_modeling_tool
- **Reasoning Style**: Analytical with multi-perspective synthesis
- **Performance Target**: 85% tool efficiency, 80% response completeness

### 3. Cross-Platform Intelligence Gatherer
- **Specialty**: Multi-platform monitoring and pattern recognition
- **Key Tools**: multi_platform_monitor_tool, social_media_monitor_tool, vector_tool
- **Reasoning Style**: Investigative with temporal analysis

from agent_training.performance_monitor import AgentPerformanceMonitor

monitor = AgentPerformanceMonitor()
report = monitor.generate_performance_report("enhanced_fact_checker", days=30)
```

### 3. Generating Additional Training Data
```python
from agent_training.synthetic_data_generator import SyntheticDataGenerator

generator = SyntheticDataGenerator(tools_available)
examples = generator.generate_training_batch("fact_checking", batch_size=100)
```

## Quality Metrics

### Target Performance Benchmarks
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ for fact-checking, 85%+ for content analysis

### Monitoring Dashboard
Performance metrics are tracked across:
- Response quality trends
- Tool usage patterns
- Error frequency and types
- User satisfaction scores
- Efficiency improvements over time

## Continuous Improvement

The system implements autonomous learning through:
1. **Performance Feedback Loops**: Real usage data informs training priorities
2. **Adaptive Training**: Additional synthetic data generated for weak areas
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Dynamic adjustment based on success patterns
4. **Tool Usage Refinement**: Optimization of tool selection and sequencing

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Monitor performance reports weekly
- Review tool usage patterns for optimization opportunities
- Add real-world examples to training sets when edge cases are discovered
- Adjust performance thresholds based on operational requirements

### For Operations
- Set up automated performance monitoring in production
- Implement quality assessment scoring in your command handlers
- Create feedback loops for user satisfaction measurement
- Regular backup of training data and performance history

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Low Performance Scores**: Check training data quality and prompt effectiveness
2. **Poor Tool Usage**: Review tool selection logic and sequence optimization
3. **High Error Rates**: Investigate error patterns and add error-handling training
4. **Slow Response Times**: Optimize tool sequences and consider parallel processing

### Performance Recovery
- Re-run enhancement with updated training data
- Adjust reasoning frameworks based on failure patterns
- Increase synthetic training data for problematic scenarios
- Fine-tune performance thresholds and quality criteria
