"""Archive package exposing high-level archival helpers.

Previously this module eagerly imported the Discord FastAPI archive implementation
(`archive.discord_store.api`) which pulled in `fastapi` during *any* import of
`archive` (for example through `memory.api`). This caused test collection to fail
early if optional web dependencies were not yet installed. We now lazy-load the
concrete implementation on first access while keeping the public API stable.

Usage:
        from archive import archive_file  # unchanged

If the Discord archive implementation (and its dependencies) are unavailable,
an ImportError is raised only when `archive_file` is first usedâ€”not at import time.
This mirrors other optional-subsystem patterns in the codebase.
