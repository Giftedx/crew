# Final Review Summary

## 1. Executive Overview

This comprehensive audit established a phased modernization path for routing intelligence, retrieval quality, memory lifecycle management, cost efficiency, and observability. We produced 12 prioritized feature initiatives, feasibility scores, a sequenced roadmap, quantified performance targets, risk mitigations, and governance loops—while preserving existing abstraction boundaries (flags + StepResult) for safe incremental rollout.

Key Wins:

- Clear top 5 near-term initiatives (LinTS, A/B Harness, Dynamic Trimming, Semantic Cache, Cost-Aware Routing)
- Unified experiment & measurement framework (A/B harness + performance estimate baselines)
- Retrieval & memory evolution plan (Fusion → Pruning → Compression) minimizing regression risk
- Comprehensive risk catalog with explicit rollback triggers
- Quantified impact ranges enabling ROI tracking & expectation management

## 2. Strategic Pillars

| Pillar | Objective | Representative Features |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Efficiency | Reduce cost & latency without quality loss | Dynamic Trimming, Semantic Cache, Prompt Compression, Speculative Decoding |
| Quality | Elevate answer & retrieval relevance | Retrieval Fusion, KG Augmentation, Memory Pruning (signal density) |
| Governance & Safety | Observability, controlled rollout, risk handling | A/B Harness, Risk Catalog, Rollback Playbook |
| Extensibility | Enable future advanced policies & data products | LinTS, Bootstrapped UCB, NeuralUCB, Cost-Aware Routing |

## 3. Success Criteria Matrix (Targets)

| Feature | Primary Metric | Target | Stretch |
|---------|---------------|--------|---------|
| LinTS | Regret ↓ | 3–5% | 8% |
| Dynamic Trimming | Token Reduction | 15% | 20% |
| Semantic Cache | Hit Ratio | 25% | 35% |
| Cost-Aware Routing | Cost per Success ↓ | 10% | 15% |
| Retrieval Fusion | nDCG@10 ↑ | +5 pts | +7 pts |
| Memory Pruning | Storage Growth ↓ | 30% | 40% |
| Prompt Compression | Compression Ratio | 30% | 40% |
| Bootstrapped UCB | Reward Non-Degradation | Stable | Variance +15% |
| KG Augmentation | nDCG@10 (Entity) ↑ | +3 pts | +5 pts |
| Speculative Decoding | p95 Latency ↓ | 15% | 20% |
| NeuralUCB | Regret ↓ (vs LinTS) | 5% | 8% |

## 4. Monitoring Loop

Weekly:

- Experiment status review (active vs planned) & gating metric health
- Cost per success & cache hit ratio delta vs baseline
- Retrieval relevance spot-check (sample nDCG subset) if fusion/pruning/compression changes active
Monthly:
- Flag audit (retire stale flags; merge stable features)
- Risk trigger review (any near-threshold metrics?)
- Storage growth & pruning efficacy evaluation
Quarterly:
- Strategic pillar KPI alignment (are efficiency gains slowing?)
- Recalibrate estimation model (MAPE of predicted vs actual improvements)
- Security/privacy log sampling & PII leakage audit

## 5. Operational Runbook Summary

Flags Lifecycle:

1. Implement behind disabled flag
2. Shadow (log only)
3. Canary (limited exposure)
4. Full rollout (flag eventually removed or inverted)
Experiment Launch Checklist:

- Define primary & guard metrics
- Compute MDE & sample size requirement
- Configure variant labels & dashboards
- Register rollback triggers
Rollback Steps (all features):

1. Disable flag
2. Clear transient state (cache/ensemble artifacts)
3. Annotate dashboards with incident tag
4. Capture 15m post-disable metrics
5. File RCA & add regression test if applicable

## 6. Recommendation Tiers

Quick Wins (<1 week each): LinTS, Dynamic Trimming, A/B Harness (MVP), Semantic Cache (shadow), Cost-Aware Routing (scoring skeleton)
Strategic (1–4 weeks cumulative, parallelizable in parts): Retrieval Fusion, Memory Pruning, Prompt Compression, Bootstrapped UCB
Deferred / Advanced (>1 month or dependency-heavy): KG Augmentation, Speculative Decoding, NeuralUCB

## 7. Continuous Improvement Backlog Seeds

- Automated weight tuning for Retrieval Fusion (Bayesian optimization)
- Adaptive semantic cache TTL based on concept drift detection
- Privacy enhancing semantic cache encryption & differential access logs
- Reward shaping refinements (negative rewards for policy violations)
- Bayesian A/B engine to shorten decision cycles
- Real-time latency budget allocator (dynamic per model)
- Graph-based semantic cluster summarization pre-pruning

## 8. Review Re-Trigger Conditions

Initiate a new comprehensive review if ANY:

- Cost per success improves <2% across two consecutive quarters despite pending features
- Retrieval relevance (nDCG@10) regresses ≥2 pts sustained 2 weeks
- Cache hit ratio stagnates <15% after 6 weeks post full rollout
- Latency p95 increases ≥15% quarter-over-quarter without new features
- Flag count > 2x retired flags (indicates governance debt)

## 9. Closure Statement

The system is positioned for iterative, low-risk enhancement with explicit quantitative gates. Immediate execution focus: finalize A/B harness, promote LinTS, validate trimming efficacy, then unlock cost & relevance gains via semantic caching and fusion retrieval—before embarking on heavier graph and advanced RL investments. This document, along with the feasibility matrix, risks, roadmap, and performance estimates, forms a living governance package; maintain currency by updating after each major rollout retrospective.
