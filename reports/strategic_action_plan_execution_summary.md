- ✅ Async adoption validated (142 async functions identified)
- ✅ Caching strategy confirmed effective (4+ @lru_cache implementations)
- ✅ No blocking performance issues identified

**Impact:** Documented healthy performance profile with optimization recommendations

#### Phase 5: Test Coverage Expansion ✅

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Completed Actions:**

- ✅ Added 5 new LearningEngine migration tests (edge cases, initialization, consistency)
- ✅ Added 4 new HTTP retry edge case tests (flag validation, parameter acceptance)
- ✅ Fixed 13 dynamic context trimming tests (all passing)
- ✅ All 22 migration-related tests passing in 0.23s

**Impact:** Enhanced robustness and confidence in migrated code paths
