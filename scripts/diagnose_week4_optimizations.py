        Hello everybody, it's Ethan calling from my basement. Beautiful Friday evening,
        my kids just went to sleep, and I open Reddit to browse my community, who I love so well.
        And at the top of the subreddit, is this very lovely clip entitled, just casual panel
        provided by Twitch at their con broadcasted on their official channel. What is it?
        Well, it's a panel hosted by Frogan and friends, in which they have a tier list where
        they rate people where good is Arab, and bottom is Sabra. Yeah, I wonder where they're
        going to put Hassan. I'm going to guess they're going to put him in Arab. He's Turkish.
        He's a brother. Yeah. I think he'd be on Arab code. I would put him in Arab.
        The next person is one of my favorite people. Ethan Klein. I told you guys to climb.
        You guys are missing a category for Zionist. We're very proud of you, Dan, for bringing
        anti-Semitism right on stage, and you guys are killing it. Do you know that there is an
        Arab to Jew tier list happening in front of your sponsor? I love that they're boycotting
        hummus, and sitting in front of a Chevron logo. We know Twitch plays favorites with everything.
        If they were really serious about anti-Semitism, Sneako and Fresh and Fit would never have
        been brought back to the platform. Their whole platform for the past year has just been
        anti-Semitism. I'm not even kidding. I watch this clip, and I'm like, what am I watching?
        This is mad. I need to say something. Let's be real guys. Imagine this flipped. No one else
        would get that treatment. Don't even try to pretend or act like this is some innocent
        little mistake. I'm glad you have a Jewish friend. But at the end of the day, let's get real.
        Get your shit together.
