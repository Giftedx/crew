### Docs Conventions

- Use concise, skimmable sections; add examples where helpful
- Keep [docs/configuration.md](mdc:docs/configuration.md) and tools reference updated
- Use internal links with `mdc:` paths; avoid bare URLs
- Maintain front-matter in rules with `alwaysApply` or `description`

### Docs Conventions (required)

- All docs live under `docs/` in approved categories (strategy, architecture, operations, testing, security, agents, history).
- Every doc MUST include front-matter:

```yaml
---
title: Title Case
origin: <source_or_reason>
status: draft|migrated|canonical|deprecated|archived
last_moved: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

- Single H1 that matches `title`. Lint: MD025, MD022/MD031, MD010, MD029, MD036, MD040, MD047.

### Migration & Index

- When moving/renaming: update `last_moved`, amend `docs/ROOT_DOCS_INDEX.md`, fix inbound links, and deprecate or tombstone old paths.

### Naming

- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for conceptual/specs; lower-kebab-case for procedural guides.
