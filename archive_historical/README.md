## Key Outcomes

1. **Unified Cache Platform** - Single cache abstraction across Redis, in-memory, and file-based backends
2. **Unified Memory Service** - Consolidated memory operations with graph, vector, and episodic storage
3. **Unified Routing** - Consistent model routing with semantic caching and bandits
4. **Unified Orchestration** - Pipeline-based task orchestration with circuit breakers
5. **Unified Analytics** - Consolidated metrics and observability

## Architecture Decision Records

See `docs/architecture/` for ADRs documenting these decisions.
