# Week 4 Threshold Tuning - IN PROGRESS

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: ✅ Configuration tuned | 🔄 Validation running  
**Terminal ID**: f7321afb-07b1-4a9c-a6f4-37baa14aa4a2

## What We've Done

### 1. Diagnostic Analysis ✅
- Created `scripts/diagnose_week4_optimizations.py`
- Identified exact current thresholds:
  - Quality filtering: 0.65
  - Early exit confidence: 0.80
  - Content routing: pattern-based (no threshold)

### 2. Root Cause Confirmed ✅
- **Quality filtering**: Test content scored 0.8375 quality > 0.65 threshold → no bypass
- **Early exit**: Test content had 0.60 confidence < 0.80 threshold → no exit
- **Content routing**: Discussion content correctly routed to deep_analysis/standard

### 3. Threshold Tuning Applied ✅
- **Quality filtering**: 0.65 → 0.55 (via `QUALITY_MIN_OVERALL` env var)
- **Early exit**: 0.80 → 0.70 (in `config/early_exit.yaml`)
- Expected impact: 45-60% combined improvement (vs 1.2% baseline)

### 4. Validation Running 🔄
- Script: `scripts/run_tuned_validation.py`
- Tests: Baseline → Quality (0.55) → Early Exit (0.70) → Combined
- Expected duration: ~5-10 minutes
- Output: `benchmarks/week4_tuned_validation_*.json`

## Expected Outcomes

### Optimistic (65%+ improvement)
- Bypass rate: 20-30% of content
- Exit rate: 15-25% of content
- Quality filtering now helps instead of hurts
- **Action**: Deploy to production immediately

### Realistic (45-60% improvement)
- Moderate bypass and exit rates
- Significant improvement over 1.2% baseline
- May need slight further tuning
- **Action**: Consider additional tuning or deploy with monitoring

### Pessimistic (<45% improvement)
- Thresholds still too conservative
- Need more aggressive tuning OR diverse test content
- **Action**: Lower thresholds further or expand test suite

## Configuration Changes

### Before Tuning
```yaml
# Quality Filtering
QUALITY_MIN_OVERALL: 0.65

# Early Exit (config/early_exit.yaml)
min_exit_confidence: 0.80
```

### After Tuning
```yaml
# Quality Filtering
QUALITY_MIN_OVERALL: 0.55  # -0.10 (more aggressive)

# Early Exit (config/early_exit.yaml)  
min_exit_confidence: 0.70  # -0.10 (more aggressive)
```

### Rationale
- Test content quality: 0.8375 (very high)
- Lowering to 0.55 allows bypassing mid-range quality content
- Test confidence: 0.60 (medium)
- Lowering to 0.70 allows more early exits on medium-confidence content

## Next Steps

### When Validation Completes

1. **Check results file**:
   ```bash
   cat benchmarks/week4_tuned_validation_*.json | jq .
   ```

2. **Review improvement**:
   - Combined improvement ≥ 65%: ✅ Deploy to production
   - Combined improvement 50-64%: ⚠️ Consider more tuning
   - Combined improvement 30-49%: ⚠️ Expand test suite or adjust further
   - Combined improvement < 30%: ❌ Investigate why tuning didn't work

3. **Production Deployment** (if ≥65%):
   ```bash
   export ENABLE_QUALITY_FILTERING=1
   export QUALITY_MIN_OVERALL=0.55
   export ENABLE_CONTENT_ROUTING=1
   export ENABLE_EARLY_EXIT=1
   export ENABLE_DASHBOARD_METRICS=1
   
   # Start server with dashboard
   uvicorn server.app:create_app --factory --port 8000
   ```

4. **Document final config**:
   - Update production deployment guide
   - Document optimal threshold values
   - Create monitoring/alerting guide
