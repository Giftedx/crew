## Executive Summary

Week 4 tested algorithmic optimization strategies to improve performance through:
- Quality threshold filtering (skip low-quality content)
- Content type routing (specialized pipelines)
- Early exit conditions (confidence-based termination)

**Baseline Reference:** 2.84 minutes
