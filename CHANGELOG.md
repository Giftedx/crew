### Configuration Changes

- Added `ENABLE_LEGACY_CREW` flag for legacy crew support
- Added `ENABLE_CREW_MODULAR` flag for modular crew system
- Added `ENABLE_CREW_REFACTORED` flag for refactored crew system
- Added `ENABLE_CREW_NEW` flag for new crew system
- Added `ENABLE_DISCORD_PUBLISHING` flag for Discord artifact publishing
- Added `DISCORD_DRY_RUN` flag for testing Discord publishing

### Files Added

- `docs/architecture/overview.md` - System architecture documentation
- `docs/architecture/diagram.mmd` - Mermaid architecture diagram
- `docs/quality-gates.md` - Quality gate requirements and procedures
- `docs/architecture/design-note-v1.md` - Design decisions and alternatives
- `docs/runbook.md` - Operations runbook and troubleshooting guide
- `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/crew_consolidation.py` - Crew consolidation shim
- `scripts/stepresult_compliance_check.py` - StepResult compliance checker
- `scripts/test_observability.py` - Observability testing script
- `scripts/post_to_discord.py` - Discord artifact publisher

### Files Modified

- `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/main.py` - Updated to use crew consolidation
- `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/config/feature_flags.py` - Added crew consolidation flags
- `docs/configuration.md` - Updated with new feature flags
- `README.md` - Added reference to quality gates documentation

### Breaking Changes

- None (all changes are backward compatible)

### Migration Guide

1. **Crew Consolidation**: No migration required - uses canonical crew by default
2. **Feature Flags**: New flags are disabled by default
3. **Discord Publishing**: Requires `ENABLE_DISCORD_PUBLISHING=true` and webhook URL
4. **StepResult Compliance**: Existing tools continue to work, compliance improvements recommended

### Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Improved crew routing efficiency
- **Positive**: Enhanced observability and monitoring
- **Neutral**: Discord publishing only active when enabled
- **Neutral**: StepResult compliance checker is optional

### Security Considerations

- **Discord Publishing**: Requires webhook URL configuration
- **Tenant Isolation**: Maintained in all new features
- **PII Filtering**: Preserved in observability enhancements
- **Access Control**: No changes to existing security model

### Known Issues

- StepResult compliance rate is 52.4% (target: 98%)
- Some tools may need StepResult migration
- Discord publisher requires webhook configuration
- Observability tests show some minor issues with StepResult.skip attribute

### Future Improvements

- Complete StepResult compliance migration
- Enhanced observability dashboard
- Advanced Discord publishing features
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Additional crew implementation options

### Dependencies

- No new dependencies added
- Existing dependencies maintained
- Optional Discord webhook for publishing features

### Testing

- Added comprehensive observability testing
- StepResult compliance checking
- Discord publisher testing
- Crew consolidation validation
- Documentation validation

### Documentation

- Complete architecture documentation
- Operational runbook
- Quality gate procedures
- Configuration reference updates
- Design decision documentation
