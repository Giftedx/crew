## Overview

Original coordination placeholder migrated from root. Serves as a drop zone for cross-cutting change summaries (flags, observability, deprecations) when opening broad PRs. Not referenced by runtime code.

### Usage

- Summarise feature flags added/removed.
- List observability impacts (new metrics, traces, dashboards).
- Note deprecations introduced or advanced to removal.
- Link related strategy / architecture docs when broader context exists.
