        self.function_calling = OpenAIFunctionCallingService()
        self.streaming = OpenAIStreamingService()
        self.voice = OpenAIVoiceService()
        self.vision = OpenAIVisionService()
        self.multimodal = MultimodalAnalysisService()
        self.fallback = OpenRouterService()  # Fallback service
```
