# Part B: Feature Roadmap for Creator Value

This document outlines the feature roadmap for the Creator Intelligence system, with detailed specifications for each proposed feature.

## B1. Prioritization Framework

All features will be prioritized using the RICE scoring model, which provides a consistent framework for evaluating and ranking potential initiatives.

- **Reach:** How many users will this feature impact over a specific time period? (e.g., number of producers, editors, or viewers)
- **Impact:** How much will this feature impact individual users? (Scored on a scale: 3 for massive impact, 2 for high, 1 for medium, 0.5 for low, 0.25 for minimal)
- **Confidence:** How confident are we in our estimates for Reach, Impact, and Effort? (Expressed as a percentage: 100% for high confidence, 80% for medium, 50% for low)
- **Effort:** How much time will this feature require from the entire team? (Measured in person-months)

The final RICE score is calculated as:

`(Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort`

Each feature specification will include a detailed RICE table with a clear rationale for each score.
