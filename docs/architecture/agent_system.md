## Agent Communication Patterns

### Hierarchical Coordination

The Mission Orchestrator serves as the central coordination hub, managing task sequencing and resource allocation across all specialist agents.

### Peer-to-Peer Collaboration

Specialist agents collaborate directly when their domains overlap:

- **Analysis Cartographer** ↔ **Verification Director**: Insight mapping informs claim prioritization
- **Risk Intelligence Analyst** ↔ **Persona Archivist**: Trust metrics inform dossier updates
- **Signal Recon Specialist** ↔ **Trend Intelligence Scout**: Real-time signals inform trend detection

### Cross-Layer Integration

Agents from different layers integrate for comprehensive intelligence:

- **Knowledge Integrator** provides memory context to all analysis agents
- **Community Liaison** translates technical outputs for public consumption
- **System Reliability Officer** monitors all agent performance
