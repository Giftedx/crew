## 2. Type Safety Analysis

### MyPy Configuration

The project uses MyPy for static type checking with comprehensive configuration:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
check_untyped_defs = true
```

### Type Safety Strengths

- **Comprehensive Type Hints**: Most functions include complete type annotations
- **StepResult Pattern**: Consistent return type across all tools and services
- **Generic Types**: Proper use of generics for tool return types
- **Dataclass Usage**: Extensive use of dataclasses for structured data

### Type Safety Challenges

- **Baseline Errors**: Current baseline of 120 MyPy errors (as mentioned in rules)
- **Legacy Code**: Some older modules may lack complete type annotations
- **Complex Types**: Advanced type patterns in AI/ML components need refinement
- **External Dependencies**: Type stubs for some third-party libraries

### Type Safety Recommendations

1. **Incremental Improvement**: Continue reducing MyPy error baseline
2. **Type Coverage**: Expand type annotations to 100% of public APIs
