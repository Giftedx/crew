# PostHog Telemetry Fix Applied

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** CrewAI PostHog telemetry causing connection errors to `us.i.posthog.com:443`  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## What Was Changed

### 1. Environment Variables Added to `.env`

```bash
# Disable CrewAI telemetry (PostHog analytics) - multiple flags for compatibility
CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT=1
OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true
DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

### 2. Code Patches Applied

#### File: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/autonomous_orchestrator.py`

- **Location:** After CrewAI import (line ~39)
- **Change:** Added telemetry singleton reset and environment variable enforcement

```python
# CRITICAL: Disable PostHog telemetry immediately after import
try:
    from crewai.telemetry import Telemetry
    Telemetry._instance = None  # Reset singleton
    os.environ["CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY"] = "1"
    os.environ["OTEL_SDK_DISABLED"] = "true"
except Exception:
    pass
```

#### File: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/crew.py`

- **Location:** After CrewAI import (line ~21)
- **Change:** Same telemetry disable patch as above

### 3. Restart Script Created

**File:** `scripts/restart_discord_bot.sh`

- Cleanly stops existing bot processes
- Loads environment variables from `.env`
- Displays telemetry flag status
- Starts Discord bot with proper configuration

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/restart_discord_bot.sh
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes and restarting the bot:

1. ✅ **No more PostHog connection warnings** in terminal output
2. ✅ **No more urllib3 retry warnings** for `us.i.posthog.com`
3. ✅ **No more backoff INFO messages** from CrewAI telemetry
4. ✅ **Cleaner log output** - only actual workflow messages

## Verification Steps

1. Stop the current Discord bot: `pkill -f ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot`
2. Run: `./scripts/restart_discord_bot.sh`
3. Test with `/autointel` command
4. Verify logs show no PostHog connection attempts

## Why This Works

CrewAI's telemetry system has a **singleton pattern** that initializes on first import. By:

1. Setting environment variables in `.env`
2. Resetting the singleton immediately after import
3. Re-enforcing environment variables programmatically

We ensure telemetry is disabled **before** any CrewAI components try to send analytics.

## Fallback Solution

If PostHog errors still appear (unlikely), you can block the domain at firewall level:

```bash
# Add to /etc/hosts (requires sudo)
127.0.0.1 us.i.posthog.com
127.0.0.1 app.posthog.com
127.0.0.1 eu.i.posthog.com
```

- Performance guide: `AUTOINTEL_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md`
- Environment template: `.env.example` (lines 290-292)

## Notes

- These changes do **not** affect workflow functionality
- All agents, tools, and memory systems work identically
- Only analytics/telemetry is disabled
- No performance impact (actually slightly faster due to no network overhead)

---

**Next Steps:** Restart the bot and test with `/autointel` to verify the fix works!
