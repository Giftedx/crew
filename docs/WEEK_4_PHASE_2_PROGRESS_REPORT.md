### Projected Combined Impact

Based on quality filtering results and Phase 2 design:

**Conservative Estimate**:

- Quality filtering: 50% (conservative)
- Content routing: 10% (additional)
- Early exit: 15% (additional)
- **Total**: 75% reduction
- **Time**: 2.84 min → 0.71 min (42.6 seconds)

**Aggressive Estimate** (if all match quality_filtering):

- Quality filtering: 62%
- Content routing: 15%
- Early exit: 20%
- **Total**: 97% reduction (unrealistic, likely overlap)
- **Time**: 2.84 min → 0.09 min (5.4 seconds)

**Realistic Combined** (accounting for overlap):

- **Total**: 65-80% reduction
- **Time**: 2.84 min → 0.57-0.99 min (34-59 seconds)

## 📝 Configuration Recommendations (Preliminary)

### Based on Quality Filtering Results

**Current Configuration** (Balanced):

```yaml
# config/quality_filtering.yaml
thresholds:
  min_overall: 0.65  # Tested, effective
  min_coherence: 0.60
  min_completeness: 0.60
  min_informativeness: 0.60
```

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Keep current thresholds**

- 0.65 threshold achieves 62% improvement
- Conservative enough to maintain quality
- Can test more aggressive (0.60) if quality metrics confirm

**Future Tuning Options**:

1. **More Aggressive** (if quality holds):
   - `min_overall: 0.60` (expect 70% improvement)
2. **More Conservative** (if quality concerns):
   - `min_overall: 0.70` (expect 50% improvement)
