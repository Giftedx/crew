```python
# Already implemented in orchestrator.py
async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
    memory_task = tg.create_task(analysis_memory_task, name="analysis_memory")
    transcript_task = tg.create_task(transcript_task, name="transcript_memory")
    graph_task = tg.create_task(graph_task, name="graph_memory")
