# Immediate Fixes Needed

## ✅ Good News: Data Flow Fix Is Working

Your logs show the fix is working correctly:

```
🔄 Updating tool context with keys: ['mission_url', 'mission_depth', ...]
📋 Available parameters before filtering: [...]
✅ Kept parameters: ['url', 'quality']
✅ PipelineTool executed successfully
```

The PipelineTool received the URL and successfully downloaded the video!

## ⚠️ Issues to Fix

### 1. Install Whisper for Audio Transcription (CRITICAL)

**Current**: Using metadata-only fallback (just title + description)
**Needed**: Full audio transcription with timestamps

**Fix**:

```bash
# In your activated venv
source /home/crew/.venv/bin/activate
pip install 'openai-whisper>=20231117'

# Or use the whisper extra
pip install -e '.[whisper]'
```

**Note**: Whisper requires Python 3.11 (you have 3.11.9 ✅). If you get numba issues on 3.12+, stay on 3.11.

### 2. Fix OpenRouter API Error (404)

**Error**:

```
ERROR: OpenRouterService route failed task=analysis model=openai/gpt-4o-mini 
provider=unknown err=openrouter_error status=404
```

**Possible causes**:

1. Invalid API key
2. Wrong model name
3. API endpoint issue

**Check your API key**:

```bash
# Test the key
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 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"
```

**If key is valid**, the 404 might be from model routing. Check logs for the exact model being requested.

**Quick workaround**: Use OpenAI directly instead:

```bash
# In .env, ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set (you have it ✅)
# The system will fall back to OpenAI if OpenRouter fails
```

### 3. Enable Experimental Depth (Optional)

Your command used `depth:experimental` but the system may have fallen back. To enable:

```bash
# Add to .env
ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DEPTH=1
```

## Quick Test After Fixes

```bash
# 1. Install Whisper
source /home/crew/.venv/bin/activate
pip install 'openai-whisper>=20231117'

# 2. Verify OpenRouter key or disable
# Option A: Test the key (see above)
# Option B: Temporarily disable to use OpenAI only
# (comment out OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env)

# 3. Run again
make run-discord-enhanced

# 4. In Discord, run:
# /autointel url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtFiJ8AVdW0 depth:standard
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

**Before (Current)**:

```
⚠️ Transcription: metadata-fallback (just title/description)
❌ Analysis: OpenRouter 404 error
```

**After Fixes**:

```
✅ Transcription: Full audio transcript with timestamps
✅ Analysis: Proper content analysis with insights
✅ Fact checks against actual transcript content
✅ Memory storage with structured data
```

## Verification Checklist

After installing Whisper and fixing API:

- [ ] No "whisper package is not installed" errors
- [ ] No OpenRouter 404 errors
- [ ] Transcription shows actual spoken content (not just metadata)
- [ ] Analysis contains specific insights from video content
- [ ] Tools receive full transcript (check for aliasing logs)

## Understanding Current State

Your **data flow fix is working perfectly**! The issues you're seeing are:

1. Missing dependency (whisper) - easy fix
2. API configuration issue - needs investigation

The core problem we fixed (tools not receiving data) is **resolved** ✅

The logs showing:

```
🔄 Updating tool context with keys: [...]
✅ Aliased transcript→text (X chars)
```

...prove the fix is working. Once Whisper is installed, those logs will show the full transcript being passed to analysis tools.

## Next Steps Priority

1. **HIGH**: Install Whisper (`pip install 'openai-whisper>=20231117'`)
2. **HIGH**: Verify OpenRouter API key or use OpenAI fallback
3. **MEDIUM**: Re-run the command and check logs
4. **LOW**: Enable experimental depth if desired

The system is very close to working fully! Just needs these dependency/config fixes.
