# /autointel Immediate Action Plan

## üî¥ Critical Issue Summary

Your `/autointel` command is experiencing failures where:

- Tools are failing to execute
- Tools are being misused  
- Tools are not receiving correct content data

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

### 1. Enhanced JSON Extraction (APPLIED)

**File Modified**: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/autonomous_orchestrator.py`

**Changes**:

- Upgraded from 2 to 4 JSON extraction strategies
- Added fallback text extraction when JSON parsing fails
- Enhanced debug logging to see raw LLM outputs
- Added warnings when no data is extracted

This fixes the **fragile JSON extraction** issue where if the LLM doesn't format JSON perfectly, the entire workflow breaks.

### 2. Created Diagnostic Script

**New File**: `scripts/diagnose_autointel.py`

Run this to capture detailed logs showing exactly where failures occur.

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Run the Diagnostic (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/crew
python scripts/diagnose_autointel.py
```

This will test the full workflow and create `autointel_diagnostic.log`.

### Step 2: Share the Results

I need to see:

1. **Terminal output** from the diagnostic script
2. **First 500 lines of the log**:

   ```bash
   head -500 autointel_diagnostic.log
   ```

3. **Specific symptoms**: Which tools failed? What errors? What data was wrong?

### Step 3: I'll Provide Targeted Fixes

Once I see the actual errors, I can fix:

- Specific tool wrapper issues
- Parameter aliasing gaps
- Placeholder detection tuning
- Pydantic schema problems

## üîç What the Diagnostic Will Show

The script will reveal:

- ‚úÖ Whether JSON extraction is working
- ‚úÖ What the LLM is actually outputting (raw text)
- ‚úÖ Which extraction strategies succeed/fail
- ‚úÖ Whether fallback extraction works
- ‚úÖ Which specific tools are failing
- ‚úÖ What data they're receiving vs. what they expect

## ‚è±Ô∏è Alternative: Share Discord Bot Logs

If you're running the Discord bot, I can also work with those logs. Please share:

```bash
# If you're running the bot with systemd/docker/screen:
# Show me the logs with:
journalctl -u discord-bot -n 500
# or
docker logs discord-bot | tail -500
# or paste the terminal output
```

## üìù Quick Verification

Before running the diagnostic, verify the fix was applied:

```bash
cd /home/crew
grep -A 5 "extraction_strategies = \[" src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/autonomous_orchestrator.py
```

You should see 4 strategy tuples instead of the old 2 regex patterns.

## ‚ùì What If You Can't Run the Diagnostic?

If you can't run Python scripts, you can still help by providing:

1. **Screenshot/paste** of the Discord bot output when `/autointel` fails
2. **Any error messages** you see in the terminal where the bot is running
3. **Description** of which tools are failing (e.g., "transcription returns empty", "analysis uses placeholder text")

With any of these, I can identify the specific failures and provide fixes.

**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting for diagnostic output to provide targeted fixes

**ETA**: Once you share the logs, I can provide specific fixes within minutes
