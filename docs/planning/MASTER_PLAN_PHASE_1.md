4. **Production Deployment** - Deploy to staging and production environments
5. **Performance Optimization** - Achieve and maintain SLO targets

### Success Criteria

- All services operational and healthy
- SLO monitoring implemented and functional
- End-to-end workflows validated
- Production deployment successful
- Performance targets met or exceeded

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

1. **Parallel Execution**: Run non-dependent tasks in parallel
2. **Incremental Validation**: Validate each component as it's implemented
3. **Rollback Planning**: Maintain ability to rollback at each step
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor system health throughout implementation

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Environment Issues**: Maintain backup configurations
2. **Service Dependencies**: Implement health checks and retries
3. **Performance Degradation**: Monitor metrics continuously
4. **Deployment Issues**: Use blue-green deployment strategy

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All services operational and healthy (100% uptime)
- [ ] SLO monitoring implemented and functional
- [ ] End-to-end workflows validated (100% success rate)
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Performance targets met or exceeded

### Key Performance Indicators
