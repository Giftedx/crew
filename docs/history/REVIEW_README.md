# Review Artifacts

This repository includes a comprehensive engineering review produced on 2025-09-16.

- Main report: `COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_REVIEW.md`
  - Phased analysis (architecture, research, feasibility, recommendations, roadmap)
  - Minor code fix documented in the appendix

Quick local checks (optional):

- Quick tests: run `make test-fast`
- Compliance summaries: run `make compliance-summary`
- Full guard sweep: run `make guards`

Notes:

- Changes respect StepResult and tenant isolation contracts.
- Legacy HTTP retry flag migration fixed to honor `ENABLE_ANALYSIS_HTTP_RETRY`.
