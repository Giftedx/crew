## Ultimate Discord Intelligence Bot - Next Implementation Phase

### Mission: Implement Phase 1 AI Enhancement Features

You are continuing development of the Ultimate Discord Intelligence Bot. The codebase analysis is complete, foundations are solid, compliance is good, and tests are passing. Ready for Phase 1 feature implementation.

### 🎯 Critical Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1: A/B Testing Harness (Foundation Required)

- **Location**: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/core/rl/experiment.py`
- **Flag**: `ENABLE_EXPERIMENT_HARNESS` (exists, needs implementation)
- **Goal**: Create experiment metadata logging, variant assignment, dashboard tracking
- **Success**: Harness emits variant logs successfully

#### Task 2: LinTS Shadow Mode (Model Routing)

- **Location**: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/core/learning_engine.py`
- **Flag**: `ENABLE_RL_LINTS` (exists, needs shadow implementation)
- **Goal**: Linear Thompson Sampling for routing, reward logging, regret tracking
- **Success**: Regret reduction ≥3% in shadow mode

#### Task 3: Dynamic Context Trimming (Token Efficiency)

- **Location**: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/services/prompt_engine.py`
- **Flag**: `ENABLE_PROMPT_COMPRESSION` (exists, needs trimming logic)
- **Goal**: Intelligent context trimming before compression, token reduction
- **Success**: 15% median token reduction, relevance drop ≤1%

#### Task 4: Semantic Cache Shadow (Cost Optimization)

- **Location**: `src/ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot/services/openrouter_service.py`
- **Flag**: `ENABLE_SEMANTIC_CACHE` (exists, needs implementation)
- **Goal**: Embedding-based cache, hit potential tracking
- **Success**: 20% hit ratio, latency neutral

### 🛠️ Technical Debt Cleanup

- Extract oversized `_render_analysis_result` function into sub-functions
- Split large `_load_tools` procedural block into composable helpers
- Centralize magic numbers and UI constants
- Expand vector client test coverage with behavioral tests

### 🎛️ Required Feature Flags

```bash
ENABLE_EXPERIMENT_HARNESS=1     # A/B testing foundation
ENABLE_RL_LINTS=1              # LinTS shadow mode
ENABLE_PROMPT_COMPRESSION=1     # Context trimming
ENABLE_SEMANTIC_CACHE=1        # Semantic caching
ENABLE_RL_SHADOW=1             # Shadow mode for RL
```

### 📊 Success Metrics

| Feature | Metric | Target | Validation |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| A/B Harness | Variant Logs | Successful emission | Dashboard data |
| LinTS | Regret Reduction | ≥3% improvement | Posterior stability |
| Trimming | Token Reduction | ≥15% median | Relevance ≤1% drop |
| Cache | Hit Potential | ≥15% shadow | No latency penalty |

### 🔄 Implementation Sequence

1. **Start with A/B Testing Harness** - Foundation for measuring all other features
2. **Implement shadow mode first** - No user-facing impact during development
3. **Add comprehensive metrics** - Track all performance indicators
4. **Validate each feature** - Meet success criteria before promotion

### 🧪 Development Workflow

```bash
# Pre-implementation
make test-fast && make compliance

# During development
make test && make type && make lint

# Post-implementation
make eval && make docs
```

### 🚨 Critical Architecture Requirements

- Follow StepResult pattern (return `StepResult.ok|fail|skip`)
- Use HTTP wrappers only (never direct `requests`)
- Thread tenant context (`TenantContext` with `with_tenant`)
- All features behind `ENABLE_*` flags, default OFF
- Shadow mode first, then canary, then full deployment

### 📋 Implementation Checklist

- [ ] A/B Testing Harness operational with variant logging
- [ ] LinTS shadow mode tracking regret improvements
- [ ] Dynamic trimming achieving 15% token reduction
- [ ] Semantic cache shadow showing hit potential
- [ ] All features properly feature-flagged
- [ ] Comprehensive metrics and logging added
- [ ] Tests passing with new implementations
- [ ] Technical debt addressed (function extraction)

- `/home/crew/.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Project guidelines

### 🎯 Starting Action

Begin with **A/B Testing Harness** implementation in `core/rl/experiment.py`. This is the measurement foundation required for all subsequent features. The `ENABLE_EXPERIMENT_HARNESS` flag exists but needs the actual harness logic.

**Current State**: Foundation complete, entering Phase 1 feature development
**Next Milestone**: A/B harness operational with successful variant logging
