## Codebase Audit (Initial Pass)

Date: 2025-09-01
Scope: Documentation alignment, architecture fidelity, dependency & packaging review, test baseline, hotspot identification.

## Summary

The project presents a well‑documented multi‑service architecture with a unified content pipeline. Key strengths include: explicit feature flags, deprecation policy, structured tool interface (`StepResult`), and tenant‑aware design. Immediate blockers and risks were identified that impair test execution and could impact distribution fidelity.

## Critical Issues

| Area | Issue | Impact | Recommendation | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|----------|
| Configuration | `dotenv_values` signature mismatch (pydantic-settings -> python-dotenv) breaks *all* tests | No test signal; CI blocked | Add compatibility shim (implemented) & assert in a smoke test | High |
| Packaging | Missing packages (`discord`, `fastapi`, `ops`, `server`) in wheel config | Incomplete distribution; potential runtime import errors | Added to `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` | High |
| Service Duplication | Parallel implementations: `core.prompt_engine` vs `services.prompt_engine`; `core.token_meter` vs `services.token_meter` | Confusion, drift risk | Mark service versions deprecated or unify behind re-exports | High |
| Evaluation Harness | Duplicate modules (`eval_harness.py`, `evaluation_harness.py`) | Import ambiguity | Consolidate to single canonical module + deprecation notice | Medium |
| Pipeline Size | `pipeline.py` (~500+ lines) mixes orchestration, rate limiting, PII filtering | Harder to extend (parallelism, test granularity) | Refactor into step executors + middleware | Medium |
| Dependency Surface | Multiple vector / cache layers (qdrant, chroma, gptcache) & broad model SDK set | Larger attack & maintenance surface | Classify as extras; prune unused; add audit | Medium |
| Flag Governance | Many `ENABLE_` flags; drift possible | Silent feature misconfig | Add automated flag/doc sync test | Medium |

## Implemented Quick Wins (This Pass)

- Dotenv compatibility shim in `core/secure_config.py` (ignores unsupported `encoding` param).
- Added missing runtime packages to wheel build target.
- Generated this audit report for traceability.

## Pending Remediations

1. Canonicalize prompt & token modules; provide migration notes mirroring learning engine shim pattern.
1. Consolidate evaluation harness duplication.
1. Introduce `tests/test_flag_docs_sync.py` to assert each `ENABLE_` flag appears in `docs/configuration.md`.
1. Add `make audit-deps` using `pip-audit` or `uv pip audit` (if supported) plus allowlist exceptions file.
1. Decompose pipeline: extract rate limiting + PII filtering into decorators or strategy objects; isolate I/O steps for parallel execution.
1. Add caching layer for transcript reuse (hash of media ID + model) before transcription step.
1. Mark deprecated service shims with removal date banner comments & central deprecation registry entry.

## Risk Matrix (Top 5)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Test suite blocked by config loader regressions | Medium | High | Add smoke import test for `get_config()`; fallback path already patched |
| Drift between duplicated service/core modules | High | Medium | Consolidate & enforce single import path in tests |
| Missing packages in build artifact (pre-fix) | High | Medium | Fixed; add CI step verifying import of public entry points |
| Pipeline complexity inhibits optimization | Medium | Medium | Incremental refactor post-stability |
| Overlapping vector DB libs inflate footprint | Medium | Medium | Inventory usage; gate behind extras |

## Suggested Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverables | ETA |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| M1: Stabilization | Passing tests; canonical prompt/token; eval harness unified | 1-2 days |
| M2: Pipeline Modularization | Extracted step runners + middleware, baseline concurrency | 3-5 days |
| M3: Dependency Optimization | Extras split; audit tooling; reduced base install size | 5-7 days |
| M4: Observability & Flag Guard | Flag/doc sync test; tracing/metrics regression tests | 7-9 days |
| M5: Performance & Caching | Transcript + analysis cache; optional parallel steps | 9-12 days |

## Appendix: Discrepancy Table (Docs vs Code)

| Documented Component | Expected Role | Observed Implementation | Status |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Prompt Engine | Deterministic prompt building | `core/prompt_engine.build_prompt` & OO `services.prompt_engine.PromptEngine` | Dual (needs consolidation) |
| Token Meter / Cost Guard | Estimate & enforce budgets | `core/token_meter`, `services/token_meter` | Dual (needs consolidation) |
| Learning Engine | Bandit-based model routing | `core/learning_engine` + shim `services.learning_engine` (warns) | Properly deprecated |
| Evaluation Harness | Reward capture & bakeoffs | `core/eval_harness.py` & `services/eval_harness*` | Duplicate naming |
| Pipeline Step Result | Unified outcome abstraction | `step_result.py` & usage in pipeline | Aligned |
| Drive Upload Fallback | Robust pipeline under failures | Try/except fallback to bypass tool | Aligned |
| Feature Flags | Guard subsystems | Many `enable_*` fields in `SecureConfig` | Present; sync unverified |
