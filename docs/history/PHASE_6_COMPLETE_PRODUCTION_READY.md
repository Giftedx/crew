## 📈 Recommended Deployment Strategy: **CANARY**

**Strategy Details:**

- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Rollback Time**: Seconds
- **Complexity**: HIGH (Advanced deployment capabilities)
- **Rationale**: System ready for advanced canary deployment with gradual traffic shifting

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Deploy new version to small percentage of infrastructure
2. Route 5% of traffic to canary deployment
3. Monitor key performance indicators and error rates
4. Gradually increase traffic percentage (10%, 25%, 50%)
5. Validate performance at each stage
6. Complete rollout once canary proves stable

## 📋 Comprehensive Deployment Plan

### Timeline: **1-2 weeks**

### Preparation Time: **3-5 days**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation** (3-7 days)

- Finalize production environment configuration
- Complete security and performance testing
- Prepare monitoring and alerting systems
- Train operations team on new deployment
- Create detailed rollback procedures
- Schedule deployment window and communication

### **Phase 2: Production Deployment** (1-4 hours)

- Execute canary deployment strategy
- Monitor system health and performance
- Validate all health checks and metrics
- Ensure no critical alerts triggered

### **Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation** (2-6 hours)

- Execute end-to-end test suites
- Validate all critical user journeys
- Monitor system performance and stability
- Verify business metrics and functionality

### **Phase 4: System Stabilization** (1-3 days)

- Monitor extended system behavior
- Optimize performance based on real usage
- Address any minor issues discovered
- Collect user feedback and metrics

---

## 🔄 Rollback & Risk Mitigation

**Automated Rollback Triggers:**

- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 2x baseline for 10 minutes
- Critical service health check failures
- Security incident detection

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. Stop traffic routing to canary deployment
2. Route all traffic back to stable baseline
3. Terminate canary infrastructure
4. Analyze failure data and implement fixes

**Risk Level**: LOW - Comprehensive monitoring and instant rollback capabilities
