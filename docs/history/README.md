title: Historical & Deprecated Documentation
origin: root_cleanup_phase
status: canonical
last_moved: 2025-09-02
---

This directory houses deprecated, superseded, or archived documents that are
retained for traceability. Active references should point to canonical docs
outside this folder.

## Policy

1. When a document is superseded, move it here, set `status: deprecated`, and
   add a pointer at the top linking to the replacement.
1. Archived (frozen) docs use `status: archived` and must not be edited; create
   a new canonical document if evolution is required.
1. Do not place new canonical documents in this directory.

## Index

Add entries below as documents are moved:

| Old Path | Replacement | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| (pending) | | | |
