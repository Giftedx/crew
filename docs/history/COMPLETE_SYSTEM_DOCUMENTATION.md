## üîå Pilot Orchestration Endpoint (/pilot/run)

The system includes a lightweight pilot orchestration endpoint that chains ingest ‚Üí (segment?) ‚Üí (embed?) ‚Üí analysis steps and records rich pipeline metrics. Recent updates refined its robustness and backward compatibility:

- Query parameter extraction is performed directly from the `Request` object (FastAPI test shim does not auto-inject query params as function args).
- Namespace creation uses `VectorStore.namespace(tenant, workspace, "pilot")` when available; otherwise falls back to `tenant:workspace:pilot`.
- Orchestrator label: `langgraph_stub` when `ENABLE_LANGGRAPH_PILOT=1` and the lightweight stub is active; otherwise `sequential` with a degradation metric (`fallback_sequential`).
- Always emits `duration_seconds` plus per-step metrics (completed / failed / skipped) and inflight tracking.
- Optional segmentation and embedding pseudo-steps controlled via `enable_segment=1`, `enable_embed=1` query flags.

Example response (abridged):

```json
{
   "ingest": {"chunks": 2, "namespace": "acme:alpha:pilot"},
   "segment": {"segments": 8},
   "embed": {"embeddings": 8},
   "analysis": {"insights": 4},
   "duration_seconds": 0.0123,
   "orchestrator": "langgraph_stub"
}
```
