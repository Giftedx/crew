## Technical Integration Points

### 1. Service Layer Integration

```python
# Current OpenRouter service enhancement
class EnhancedOpenRouterService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.openai_client = OpenAI()
        self.responses_api = ResponsesAPI()
        self.voice_client = VoiceClient()
    
    async def process_with_structured_outputs(self, prompt: str, schema: dict) -> StepResult:
        # Use OpenAI structured outputs for better validation
        pass
    
    async def stream_response(self, prompt: str) -> AsyncGenerator:
        # Implement streaming responses for real-time updates
        pass
```

### 2. Tool Integration Patterns

```python
# Enhanced tool with OpenAI function calling
class OpenAIEnhancedTool(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self):
        self.function_schema = {
            "name": "analyze_content",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "content": {"type": "string"},
                    "analysis_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["debate", "fact_check", "sentiment"]}
                }
            }
        }
    
    async def _run(self, content: str, analysis_type: str) -> StepResult:
