rate_limiter = get_distributed_rate_limiter()
allowed, remaining, metadata = rate_limiter.allow("user_123", tokens=1)
```

**Features:**

- Global rate limiting across multiple replicas
- Graceful fallback to local rate limiting
- Lua script for atomic operations
- Comprehensive metrics and health checks

### **2. Advanced Semantic Caching**

```python
# Multi-level semantic cache with compression
from core.advanced_cache import get_advanced_cache

cache = get_advanced_cache()
cached_response, metadata = cache.get(prompt, expected_tokens=1000)
```

**Features:**

- L1: Exact match caching
- L2: Compressed prompt matching
- L3: Semantic similarity matching
- Automatic cache warming and cleanup

### **3. Comprehensive Health Checks**

```python
# Centralized health monitoring
from core.health_checker import get_health_checker

health_checker = get_health_checker()
results = await health_checker.run_all_checks()
```

**Features:**

- 10 registered health checks
- Concurrent execution for performance
- Historical tracking and metrics
- Detailed component status reporting

## Dependencies Required for Full Optimization

To enable all advanced optimizations, install:

```bash
pip install redis>=4.5.0 sentence-transformers>=2.2.0 numpy>=1.21.0
```

Or use the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.optimizations.txt
```

## Production Deployment Recommendations

- Multi-platform integration capabilities

### **Enhanced Deployment** (With Dependencies)

For optimal performance, install the optimization dependencies:

1. **Redis** for distributed rate limiting
2. **Sentence Transformers** for advanced semantic caching
3. **NumPy** for numerical operations

### **Environment Configuration**

```bash
# Required for distributed rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL_CAPACITY=60
RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL_REFILL_PER_SEC=1.0

# Optional for advanced caching
CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.85
CACHE_COMPRESSION_RATIO=0.3
CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=10000
```

## Monitoring and Alerting
