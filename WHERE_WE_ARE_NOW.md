- ✅ **All Code Committed & Pushed**: 84 commits total

**What's Next:**

- 🚀 **Deploy to Production**: Enable quality filtering (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT_READY_WEEK_4.md`)
- 📊 **Monitor Performance**: Track bypass rate, time savings, accuracy (Week 1)
- 🔧 **Tune Thresholds**: Adjust based on production data (Week 2)
- 📈 **Phase 2 Planning**: Content routing + early exit conditions (Weeks 3-4)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
export ENABLE_QUALITY_FILTERING=1
python -m ultimate_discord_intelligence_bot.setup_cli run discord
```
